            Love in its tangible form appeared as Shree Radhavallabh Lal in Shree Vishvanath’s (Lord Shiva) heart. There is no distinction between the Rasik Saints’ ultimate wealth Shree Radhavallabh Lal and the element of unconditional divine love. Love is the basis of this creation, it is in the beginning, middle and the end. <br>
            <br/>
            The significance of ‘Hita’ implying unconditional love that is  everlasting and omnipresent is universally accepted. Love is the most natural and definitive means to reach out to God. The veil between a true devotee and the divine is uncovered with pure absolute love. It is only in the state of love wherein God becomes oblivious of His Godliness and succumbs to the will of His devotee. Love is the true nature of a being. Till the being does not unconditionally accepts his true nature he cannot achieve fulfilment and cannot experience divine love.The adoration of Shree Radhavallabh Lal is the adoration of absolute love. The obtainment of the divine is inconceivable till the being is pure from within. <br>
            <br>
            Kabir established this beautifully in this couplet,<br/>
            “Kabira maan nirmal bhayaa jo Ganga ka neer, pichhe pichhe Hari phire kahat kahat Kabir Kabir”<br/>
            (Kabir’s heart is now pure like the water of the Ganga and Hari(God) follows him saying Kabir, Kabir)<br/>
            <br>
            Tulsidas’s  quatrain expresses his path of attainment of the divine, he wrote,<br/>
            “Nirmal man jan so mohi paava, mohi kapat, chhal, chhidr na bhaava”<br/>
            (I (God) only receive those with a pure heart, I(God) do not like those filled with lies, deceit and those lacking capacity to receive me.<br/>
            <br/>
            Implying that it is not possible to attain God without being pure of heart. Love is the only true emotion which has the ability to wash away the impurities that have accumulated over many lifetimes. Love alone has the capacity that can make divine love appear in the heart: turn a drop into an ocean. But for love to be depicted it needs a beautiful form and for that Shree Radhavallabh emerged.<br>
            God has 24 incarnations and Shree Krishna’s form is the supreme personality of GOD head himself. The remaining ‘avtaars’ (incarnations) have emotional limitations to connect with the varied emotions of a being. Its only with Shree Krishna that a devotee is free to establish any form of connection of love, be it as a child, a friend or a lover. Within these forms of connection, the emotion of ‘dasya’(service), vatsalya (parental love), ‘sakha’(friend), ‘kaant’ (Gopi’s love) are dominant. <br>
            <br/>
            Shree Radha is an epitome of unconditional love, compassion and worshipped by Shree Krishna himself. In this mesmerising periphery of Vrindavan, Shree Radha is "Rasa Murti" and Shree Krishna is "Bhaav Murti". But in actuality both are an expression of one love and this duality of expression is just for the fulfillment of ‘Lilas’(the bliss of which increases with every moment).<br>
            Shree Radha is ‘Rasa’ personified and at the same time the Vedanta philosphy mentions the supreme ‘Raso Vaisa’. So, Shree Radha is supreme here. She is the "Guru Tatava" as well. She is the light of grace, which makes the ‘jeevatman' (human being) eligible for this supreme love. This undisclosed secret was revealed 500 years ago by the founder of the Radhavallabh sect, Shree Hita Harivansh Mahaprabhu, a dear ‘sakhi’ (maiden friend) of Shree Radha and Shree Krishna.<br>
            <br/>
            Shree Radha and Shree Krishna’s most intimate companion (sakhi) Vanshi (flute) incarnated as Shree Hita Harivansh Mahaprabhu for the welfare of the humanity suffering in Kaliyuga. It was the grace of Lalita sakhi that the’Vanshi’ appeared on this earth, it was her humble persuasion to Shree Radha and Shree Krishna to grace the being with their love and transcendental ‘lilas’(pastimes), for which Mahaprabhu appeared in this world.<br>
            Shree Harivansh Mahaprabhu is that transcendental flow of celestial love and to bestow this nectar of love for welfare of humanity, Mahaprabuhu ji established the deity of Shree Radhavallabh Lal (whom he had received as the dowry gift from Brahman Atmadev) at Madan Ter in Shree Vrindavan Dham.<br>
            <br/>
            By lovingly serving the divine couple as their maiden-friends in the eight-time serving process (Ashtayam seva), he established  the attribute of love as a form of devotion. Love as a form of devotion itself has also been called ‘Dashdha Bhakti’ (Tenth step of bhakti which comes after nine steps of bhakti ‘Navdha Bhakti’).<br>
            This devotion process is that stage of self-immersion where the divine couple are at the will of their maiden friends and are eternally dependent on them. This form of ‘rasa’ nectar is based on the worship of beauty. Shree Radhavallabh Lal, is one soul with two bodies, whose beauty is so alluring that with darshan itself melts the heart of most unyeilding beings. <br>
            <br/>
            Shree Radhavallabh Lal is an ocean of beauty where waves of divine love are eternally flowing and are always increasing. Their darshan stirs something within and heart starts experiencing an outpour of divine love.The presence of Shree Radhavallabh Lal and his proximity makes one’s life self reliant and free of any dualities. By doing the ‘parikrama’(circumambulation) of his divine form from head to toe, the being is spontaneously filled with divine love.<br>
            For the one who seeks  the lotus feet of the divine couple, should seek shelter in Shree Vrindavan Dham, as that is their own divine abode and of Shree Yamuna, who carries within it the unguents of sandal (angraag) and is witness to the couple’s divine pastimes. She purifies the being from all kinds of miseries.<br>
            <br/>
            Shree Vrindavan Dham’s tree-branches and leaves, that are drenched with the love of divine couple, and the ‘raj’(dust) of Vrindavan, that is blessed with the eternal flow of the nectar of love from Priyaji’s (Radharani’s) lotus feet- taking their shelter is absolutely essential. <br>
            The form of love is supremely pure while the subjects of this material world are impure. Hence except the God of love, no other can receive this emotion of the being. <br>
            Hence this love as a form of devotion should be lovingly inculcated in association with the Rasiks of Vrindavan, bearing no other desires, being free from shackles of knowledge and actions, being completely aligned with divine intentions, to pursue absolute love as a form of devotion.
